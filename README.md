To run fdf : `./fdf maps/<choose-your-map.fdf>`

The fdf program is a wireframe generator that takes .fdf format files and transforms them into tridimensional representations of relief landscapes. It manages colors and basic transformation, such as zoom, translation, rotation and Z axis scaling. This project aims for the student to get familiarized with window management and pixel insertion on screen, using MinilibX library and pure C coding.
